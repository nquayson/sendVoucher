# Info
One of the first android app proof of concepts I built while in college. A user can send a voucher stored in a sql db inside the user's account over sms. The android frontend communicates with a PHP RESTful api.  
Sends an sms notification to user after successful tranaction.

# Stack
HTML, PHP, JS
